[DEX 3 (pro)](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/), [DEX 3 RE (Red Edition)](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/), and DEX 3 LE ([Free DJ Software](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/)) were all updated today, December 12, 2017, and include a smattering of new features and a slew of performance optimizations and fixes. To say our development team needs to give their fingers rest this holiday season is a massive understatement — this is the third release this month for DEX 3 (pro)!

Read all the release notes below to see what’s new, improved, and fixed in version 3.9.0.10 for all three versions of our **best DJ mixing programs** to date. One major improvement to note is DEX 3 RE and DEX 3 LE now have 64bit Windows editions in addition to the usual 32bit (x86) release, just like DEX 3 (pro). While prior versions were optimized for the 64bit environment, true 64bit support means better resource management which equals better overall performance — from the audio engine to on-screen graphics rendering.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** If you currently have a 32bit version of DEX 3 (pro), DEX 3 RE, or DEX 3 LE be sure to un-install it first before installing the new 64bit version. Your playlists, settings, and data **will all remain intact** when doing so. Otherwise, install the new release directly over-top your existing version (make sure the existing installed version is closed)
