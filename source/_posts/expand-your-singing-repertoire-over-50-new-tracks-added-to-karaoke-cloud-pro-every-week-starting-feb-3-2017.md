## Expand Your Singing Repertoire: Over 50 New Tracks Added to Karaoke Cloud Pro Every Week Starting Feb 3, 2017!

**DigiTrax Entertainment, the Karaoke Cloud Pro karaoke subscription service provider, has announced that beginning on 3-3-17 _fifty karaoke songs_ will be added to the service each-and-every Friday.**

DigiTrax announced today that they are ramping up production and licensing efforts to ensure the selection of hit karaoke songs available to [Karaoki](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) and [Karaoke Cloud Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) users is refreshed on a weekly basis. Starting next Friday (3-3-17) subscribers will receive 50 new karaoke songs each-and-every Friday thereafter at no additional cost ($49.99-a-month for the commercial karaoke subscription service). The new release schedule is aptly being referred to as “_Fifty-Song Fridays_”.

DigiTrax’s previous commitment to releasing 20 karaoke songs each week seemed, at least to us, a tall order having a general understanding of how difficult navigating the karaoke licensing landscape in the USA is right now. With a new commitment to releasing 50 songs weekly they’ve shattered our expectations; we’re ecstatic for what is means for [Karaoki](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) users that subscribe to the [professional karaoke subscription service](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/). As any working KJ knows it’s all about the tunes and filling singer requests – now subscribers can look forward to a growing karaoke catalog to search and select from.

“_We’ve upped our game, just like the best teams do at tournament time,_” said Joe Vangieri, CEO of DigiTrax Entertainment, makers of Karaoke Cloud Pro. “_In the next few days, we’ll be announcing a major new content initiative that doesn’t just rival anything any label – karaoke or traditional – is producing right now. It blows them all away._”

DigiTrax Marketing manager also shared the following with us:

“_Today’s subscribers to Karaoke Cloud know that our service is a huge value to the up-and-coming KJ,_” said David Grimes, Marketing Manager at DigiTrax Entertainment. “_As we continue to build on our superb catalog of note-perfect karaoke songs, that value is only increasing, while the per-song costs to the KJ drop. Every single week you’re subscribed, the deal just gets better and better._”

If you’re a new karaoke host, karaoke venue or a long-time karaoke host that needs a legal karaoke library they can use for public performance there is no better time to [head into the cloud](https://www.karaokelocker.com/subscription.pl)!
