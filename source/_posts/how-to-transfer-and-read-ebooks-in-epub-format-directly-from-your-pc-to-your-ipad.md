You have purchased lots of EPUB books from various bookstores like Barnes&Noble, Google play, Kobo, etc. And now you want to read them on your newly bought iPad. So you want to copy them to your iPad. But after you directly sync them to your iPad, you find the books can't be opened in Apple Books App. That means you have failed to copy EPUB to iPad. Why you failed? Probably you can't figure it out. But don't worry for now I'm intended to tell you the reason and then show you how to successfully copy EPUB to iPad with easy steps.

### Why failed to copy EPUB to iPad

You may wonder whether there is a problem with your iPad device since iPad device actually supports EPUB format books. You're right. iPad can display EPUB books. It is the DRM (Digital Rights Management) problem that limits you to successfully copy EPUB to iPad. But Apple Books App on iPad only support Apple books or other DRM-free EPUB or PDF books. 

In order to successfully copy EPUB to iPad, you must make sure your EPUB books are DRM free.

### First, Make sure EPUB books are DRM free

This part is quite essential if your EPUB books are DRM protected. About how to check your EPUB books are DRM-free or not, you can use [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/) to open EPUB books. If you succeed to open them, then they're DRM-free. On the contrary, if you receive the following tips, it means your EPUB books are DRM-protected. 

![check whether EPUB books are DRMed or not](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/check-whether-EPUB-books-are-drmed-or-not.png)

For DRM-protected books, you need to remove DRM from EPUB books first. As I have mentioned above, your EPUB books may contain two kinds of DRM. You may have no idea about how to strip DRM protection. But don't worry for I'm just writing to solve all your problems. I have found a perfect tool for you to remove DRM from EPUB books. It's [Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) which can remove three types of DRM schemes: B&N Nook, Adobe Adept and Amazon Kindle. After test, I found it's super easy to decrypt all my EPUB books in batch within seconds. Amazing! You can download it with a free try.

**Tips:** Ensure you can view your EPUB books in ADE before removing DRM. For detailed steps, you can follow this guide to [remove DRM from your epub files](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/). 

### Then, Copy EPUB to iPad

After you make sure your EPUB books are DRM free, you can now start to copy EPUB to iPad. About how to upload EPUB to iPad, I have collected two effective methods for you.

#### Method One — Drag epub files to iPad with iTunes.

This method is the most common one. Install iTunes in your computer before you start.

**Step 1**, open iTunes & plug in your iPhone.

If you are a Window user, you need to download the latest [iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/download/) version to your computer first. If you are a Mac user, you need to update iTunes to the latest version. Then launch iTunes and connect your iPhone to your computer via USB. Then you will see a device icon on iTunes, see the below picture.

**Step 2**, click the iOS device icon, you make sure to go to **Summary** to check **Manually manage music and videos** under **Options**. Then click **Sync** and **Done** button. It may take some time to sync the content from your iPhone to iTunes. So please wait patiently.

**Step 3**, click **Books** in the left sidebar of iTunes. Then locate the epub files that you want to transfer to your iPhone. Last, drag and drop the epub books from your computer to iTunes. See the below picture.

![drag epub to itunes](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/drag-epub-to-itunes.png)

**Step 4**, it may take some time to sync the epub files to your iPhone. After the synchronization you will see the epub files on the iBook reader on iPhone.

![syncing books to iPhone](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/syncing-books-to-iPhone.png)

You may notice that now transferring epub files to iPhone with the latest iTunes version is way easier than before. 

#### Method Two: Copy EPUB to iPad without iTunes

You can also transfer EPUB to iPad without iTunes, which may save you much time if you merely want to copy one or two EPUB books to iPad.

##### 1Copy EPUB to iPad by sending email

**Step 1:** Open your mail client or email provider's website and compose a new message. Now attach your decrypted EPUB books to the email.

**Step 2:** Send the email to any of the account which has been added in iPad's stock mail application.

**Step 3:** Open your mail app and then tap on the icon of the attachment to download them. After they are downloaded, tap on them to open. Then tap on the "share" button to reveal iPad's share menu.

**Step 4:** From the menu choose "Open in iBooks" option. This will directly guide you to view your EPUB books in iBooks. Tap "Library" button and you will find your newly added EPUB books in iBooks library.

Apart from using the method of sending email, you can also simply copy DRM-free EPUB books to iPad with Dropbox.

##### 2Copy EPUB to iPad with Dropbox

**Step 1:** Install Dropbox app on your iPad.

**Step 2:** Upload your EPUB books to your Dropbox account. Run Dropbox app and then look for the EPUB books you have uploaded.

**Step 3:**  Open one of the file and then tap on the "Share" button. Next tap "Open in..." button to choose "open with iBook" on iPad.

After you successfully copy EPUB to iPad or iBooks on iPad, you can now freely read EPUB books on iPad without limitations. If you are interested in copy epub to iphone, please read [How to Copy EPUB to iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

I'm running Linux, nigga, where's your software and it's source code, now?!

 Anything third-party that demands I enter some valuable credentials into it, is untrustworthy (even in the possible-to-require-this-account-credential context of DRM). Source code, or you're passing the details elsewhere.
