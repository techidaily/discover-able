**A look back at PCDJ’s 2016**

When you’re surrounded by a great group of teammates with the same vision and many years of experience in the live performance software field it’s no surprise when you exceed many of your goals and expectations for the year.

2016 was year number 17 for PCDJ and a productive one at that. At the conclusion of each year we take a look back at some of the milestones and accomplishments attained for the PCDJ DJ software and karaoke software brand. Without further ado I’ll present you with the 2016 edition. Be on the lookout for a post next week with an in-depth look at our goals for 2017!

### PCDJ Highlights From 2016

**DJ Software and Video Mixing Software Improvements**

* Upgraded and released versions 3.6 through 3.7.5.1 of DEX 3
* Introduced the [video link](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) feature that, when enabled, allows for video loops/clips to be displayed on the mixed video output screen when only mixing audio tracks.
* The new [text, image and video overlay](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) feature allows DJs and VJs to create stunning, multilayered overlays to display on the mixed video output. Use this feature to show your logo, or truly anything you can dream up.

* Added support for 10 [DJ controllers](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) from some of the biggest DJ equipment providers in the business, including support for the [Pioneer DDJ-SB2](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/), [DDJ-RR and DDJ-RB](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/). The [Hercules DJControl JogVision](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) and [Hercules P32](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) controllers.

**Karaoke Software and Karaoke Content Updates And Improvements**

As always, we strive to be accessible to our DJ and karaoke software users. We want to ensure that when you have a question it’s answered thoroughly and professionally in a very timely fashion. We updated the PCDJ website to include a new web chat, robust support ticketing tracking system and created new [PCDJ user forums](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/).

We found new partners at MixCity Inc, the creators of [JammText](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) – a truly unique, social and interactive text-and-image-to-screen platform that works brilliantly alongside DEX 3 or Karaoki. We plan to bring you even more goodies and better support for JammText throughout 2017.

_**That’s a good look at 2016’s highlights for PCDJ. Please check back next week for a look ahead at what our goals are for 2017!**_
