**A look back at PCDJ’s 2016**

When you’re surrounded by a great group of teammates with the same vision and many years of experience in the live performance software field it’s no surprise when you exceed many of your goals and expectations for the year.

2016 was year number 17 for PCDJ and a productive one at that. At the conclusion of each year we take a look back at some of the milestones and accomplishments attained for the PCDJ DJ software and karaoke software brand. Without further ado I’ll present you with the 2016 edition. Be on the lookout for a post next week with an in-depth look at our goals for 2017!

### PCDJ Highlights From 2016

**DJ Software and Video Mixing Software Improvements**

* Upgraded and released versions 3.6 through 3.7.5.1 of DEX 3
* Introduced the [video link](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) feature that, when enabled, allows for video loops/clips to be displayed on the mixed video output screen when only mixing audio tracks.
* The new [text, image and video overlay](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) feature allows DJs and VJs to create stunning, multilayered overlays to display on the mixed video output. Use this feature to show your logo, or truly anything you can dream up.

* Released a revamped DJ controller detection protocol that allows for real-time detection of DJ controllers, even while mixing. DJs can also use up to 8 DJ controller simultaneously, with zero-configure support.
* Added support for 10 [DJ controllers](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) from some of the biggest DJ equipment providers in the business, including support for the [Pioneer DDJ-SB2](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/), [DDJ-RR and DDJ-RB](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/). The [Hercules DJControl JogVision](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) and [Hercules P32](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) controllers. [Reloop RMP-4](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) and [Mixon 4](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) are also now plug-and-play with both [DEX 3](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) and [DEX 3 RE](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) DJ programs.
* New key detection for harmonic/key mixing. Not only sync music on beat but match key for pitch-perfect blending and mashups.
* Released the totally and entirely FREE DJ software – DEX 3 LE. A feature-rich freebie anyone can mix music with. Use with your own library, iTunes media or subscribe to Pulselocker for a massive in-app catalog of music you can both stream and/or download for offline use.
* As always, updates have been free of charge for owners of DEX 3 or DEX 3 RE – and 2017 is sure to bring some very welcomed new additions that will help PCDJ’s set themselves apart from other DJs and the ‘status-quo’.

**Karaoke Software and Karaoke Content Updates And Improvements**

[KaraoQuest](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) is now supported for local area network requests and the (finally!) soon-to-be released [KaraoQ/KaraoQ360](http://karaoq360.com/) platform will surely be a game changer using the most modern in remote app technology.

As always, we strive to be accessible to our DJ and karaoke software users. We want to ensure that when you have a question it’s answered thoroughly and professionally in a very timely fashion. We updated the PCDJ website to include a new web chat, robust support ticketing tracking system and created new [PCDJ user forums](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/).

We found new partners at MixCity Inc, the creators of [JammText](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) – a truly unique, social and interactive text-and-image-to-screen platform that works brilliantly alongside DEX 3 or Karaoki. We plan to bring you even more goodies and better support for JammText throughout 2017.

_**That’s a good look at 2016’s highlights for PCDJ. Please check back next week for a look ahead at what our goals are for 2017!**_
