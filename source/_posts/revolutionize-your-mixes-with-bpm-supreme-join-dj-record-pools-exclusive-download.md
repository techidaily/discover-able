The **BPM Supreme Mobile App** for iOS and Android (Available for download in the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bpm-supreme/id1435624754?mt=8) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bpmmobile), respectively) is available now, with the goal to help to “redefine the way DJs discover music”.

The App provides subscribers with features that match the DJ record pool website, but a host of tools that assist with music discovery — which, primarily for club and performance DJs, is part of their daily routine. Finding new tracks to to work into a mix set can be a daunting and tedious task, weeding through countless tracks to find that perfect hair-raising tune. The new BPM Supreme Mobile App aims to simplify things for DJs.

> _“Our app is going to revolutionize the way that DJs search for music. Not only will they find everything they already love about BPM Supreme in the app, but they’ll also have access to stream curated sets and our entire HQ music library from anywhere,” said BPM Supreme CEO and founder, Angel “A-Rock” Castillo._

BPM Supreme has quickly risen to the top of the DJ record pool space, with a snappy modern website that’s not only ascetically pleasing but easy to navigate with charts for top downloads and new releases, exclusive remixes and edits, streaming player, and industry related news. Subscribers can now access all of this and more from their mobile device.

Something that came as a surprise is the new BPM Supreme Mobile App allows non-subscribers to stream audio and use the same tools to discover new music. It sounds like a great way to showcase the platforms polish to DJs and potential subscribers.

I downloaded the new Mobile App last night and was struck by how beautifully designed it was, along with how easy it was to navigate and browse music selections. As a first iteration it’s really good.

If you’re a subscriber that took advantage of our exclusive offer for [1-Month of Free BPM Supreme](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) you should grab the App from the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bpm-supreme/id1435624754?mt=8) (iOS) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bpmmobile) (Android).
