[Kindle az3 files](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 4/27/2016 6:40:15 AM 

I have been successfully decrypting Kindle files before. I recently had one az3 container file that would not decrypt and later another az3 file that did convert but was just blank white pages.

 Is there any way I can get you these files to see what might be done, if anything, to get these to decode? Others are probably seeing this too :)

[Cannot convert audiobooks reliably](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 4/25/2020 10:32:25 PM 

The first time I converted audiobooks following your steps and using your software, every book worked fine through chapter 1, but Chapter 2 on were blank. There were variably sized files, but they were blank. The second time I converted, every book was blank and wouldn't even play. I am trying to use MP4 and separate files for each chapter. I'm now trying MP3, which I think is vastly worse, which does not make me happy.

[Several paragraphs are missing from the DRM removed pdf](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 6/16/2020 2:33:55 AM 

Software removed the DRM from a book in Adobe Digital editions. The generated pdf has a blank (should be page 24) and so is missing text. The text is there in the ADE version of the file.

[why did it add a lot of blank pages](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 4/7/2022 9:24:52 PM 

When converting to pdf it added 100 blank pages how do i fix this?

[Can epubor convert kindle comic books to pdf?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 10/2/2023 4:22:20 AM 

Trying to convert a comic book but the resulting pdf is blank except for some book intro text. I know that epubor converts images in other books.
