Here is an interesting statistic: Only 1 out of every 300 DigiGames customers has a dedicated web page on their site that A) Highlights their trivia services and B) Has pictures to showcase their system, past performances, etc. This is a staggering low number, right? Granted, some folks purchase wireless buzzers to satisfy only a specific account, and therefore web advertising isn’t required, but such a scenario is not common. Having that dedicated web page with pictures of YOU having fun with game players who are smiling, laughing….whatever….it’s KEY to your success. Be sure that this page is directly linkable from your home page…..In other words, don’t make people have to click through a maze of options and other pages to finally see your trivia page.

Your web page checklist:

* Do you have a web page that discusses your game show system?
* Do you have pictures on your page from past performances?
* Are your pictures high quality?
* Do your pictures show your game system clearly?
* Do your pictures depict players having fun playing the game?
* Does your page have a “Call to Action” with phrases like “Call us today to find out how we can make your next event a success!” or something similar…..
