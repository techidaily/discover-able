**Each month we highlight one PCDJ [DJ Software](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) or [Karaoke Software](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) user, and their business. This month meet DJ Aaron Ray of “Next Best Thing Karaoke & Mobile DJ” located in Lakewood Colorado USA, a new DEX 3 DJ software user.**

_**PCDJ:**_ **_Why did you choose PCDJ DEX 3 for your Mobile DJ business?_**

_**A.R.:**_ I chose DEX 3 for several reasons. Most importantly, I wanted state of the art, KJ/DJ/VJ software that is compatible on many levels. PCDJ DEX 3 offers all of these functions, by allowing users to less complicate their interface experience. Keeping it simple, and moreover, _FUN!!!_

_**PCDJ:**_ _**What tip would you give to other DJs?**_

_**A.R.:**_ As a KJ/DJ of 9 years, I’d advise any new or current user of DEX 3, to use all four decks on the program! It’s much like a game of chess… Always stay at least two steps ahead of your next song/singers choice. It makes for a smooth transition and proper timing in precarious situations between songs.
