#### 2\. Simple Epub Reader

 You can also upload ebooks to it without creating an account. Uploading ebooks to Simple Epub Reader from URLs and the local computer hard drive. Simple Epub Reader will display your books in a rather clean and visual way. Then you can click on the book you want to read to open it and begin reading.

![book display](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/book-display.jpg)

After the book is opened, it will look like this:

![open epub on pc](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/open-epub-on-pc.jpg)

#### [3\. MagicScroll eBook Reader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/magicscroll-web-reader/ecldhagehndokdmaiaigoaecbmbnmfkc?hl=en)

MagicScroll eBook Reader?can be used to read epub files, but it won’t look pretty in the interface. Usually there is one ad on Simple Epub Reader's library page, while there are three on MagicScroll's page. The interface doesn't look so clean. But that doesn't matter so much, as it works well when you open books to read.

![magicscroll ebook reader](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/magicscroll-ebook-reader.jpg)

### Open Non-DRM EPUB Files on PC with Free Software

#### [1.Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/download)

You can click to download it if you don't have Calibre in your computer. Calibre can be used to read non-DRM epub files. Just click the "Add" icon to add your epub books to it and click the book to open it.

If the book is DRMed, you cannot open it and will see this window:

![drmed book](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/drmed-book-files.jpg)

 And so you cannot open DRM epub files with Calibre or the following free softwares. The non-DRM epub books will be opened normally.

#### [2\. EPUB File Reader](http://www.epubfilereader.com/)

EPUB File Reader is a free epub files viewer. It can help you to open and read DRM-free epub ebooks and documents. The software interface consists of two parts, the left will show document chapter directory and the right is a browser to show document content. I think this is better for us to read the books compared with other softwares. This software is very easy to use. It is also completely free. Through the "File" menu, you can "Open" and "Close" a EPUB file (file extension is .epub).

You can see that DRM epub files only can be opened in certain e-readers.

I was trying to erase the stars - it didn't work. Everything I read had to do with reading my books on my PC. I assume that means Personal Computer. I'm 83\. I don't want to sit at my desktop PC and read a book. I've been trying for hours to load the books I bought onto my iPad Nook reader. None of it works and I finally got sent here.

 Crap. What kind of hoops does everyone expect me to jump through? I'm 83 and I have trouble walking, let alone trying to jump!

 Why is this so difficult? When I get my regular books on Nook, I look at Freebooksy; tap on the bar that says "NOOK" and voila! my book appears on my iPad Nook.

 Now that I've paid for the rest of the series, there is NO way (so it seems) to get them on my iPad.

 What do I need to do? My back is sore from sitting at this desktop and trying.

 Anyone there with a compassionate heart and a lot of patience who can help me?

 Hopefully yours,
