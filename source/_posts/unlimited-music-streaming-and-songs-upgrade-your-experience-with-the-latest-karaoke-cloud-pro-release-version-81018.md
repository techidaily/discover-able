[Karaoke Cloud Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) is the widely popular karaoke subscription from Digitrax Entertainment that’s baked right into [Karaoki](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) — the standalone karaoke software for Windows that’s used by karaoke hosts all over the globe.

For only $49.99-a-month, karaoke hosts and karaoke venues can access a library of over 4,300 MP3+G style karaoke songs, with additional karaoke songs are added every month at no additional cost. Karaoke Cloud Pro is super easy to use because the subscription karaoke music is accessed from within the Karaoki software browser. Just select and retrieve the latest karaoke songs to your hard drive so you can access and play them offline, or online, with Karaoki. Export a song book from Karaoki when you’re done for your karaoke singers.

Over the last month Digitrax has been hard at work licensing new karaoke tunes, with a total of 88 new karaoke songs added. Check out the list below! If you haven’t already tried Karaoke Cloud Pro it’s easy to [start a no-strings-attached, fully-functional 14 day free trial](https://www.karaokelocker.com/subscription.pl). Just make sure you have [Karaoki installed first](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/)!
