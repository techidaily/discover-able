When it comes right down to it, the known universe is equally as big or mysterious or capable as any act occurring in it, as they go clasp in clasp would likely be the guess or so it would seem--while on their way. But Randall Kazamp, at his age in this story hasn't even completely developed a guess--as he is still a boy. Randall, though, is different than any other boy; but, yet, he is quite the same--and just like the Universe, they specifically are all growing-up, which is also the theme of the book Yardrof--with its rounded 51,000 words. From the Kazamp backyard, where Randall Kazamp helps his father, Peter Kazamp--a scientist, tend his goldenrain trees, to Randall's help as 'the breaking molds' by his entrance into a rather hushed radar telescope site located in his hometown, and then off in scope to a parallel world that Randall helps bring into focus in one apparent mode that results with an official glimpse--might all be described as strange in this story. But following his helpful acts, Randall strangely, though naturally his best, helpfully helps himself to his very own; his mind that's on course to being a man's. The science fiction story takes place in the quaint town of Yardrof, within an environment setting of the first quarter of the twenty-second century. Genre: Science Fiction YARDROF\_Chapter-One\_FREE is an ePUB eBook for a sneak peek at the novel YARDROF, and can be freely downloaded.

Amazon said: Readers of epic fantasy series are: (1) patient--they are left in suspense between each volume, (2) persistent--they reread or at least review the previous book(s) when a new installment comes out, (3) strong--these 700-page doorstoppers are heavy, and (4) mentally agile--they follow a host of characters through a myriad of subplots. In A Game of Thrones, the first book of a projected six, George R.R. Martin rewards readers with a vividly real world, well-drawn characters, complex but coherent plotting, and beautifully constructed prose, which Locus called "well above the norms of the genre."

| ![Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/220px-50ShadesofGreyCoverArt.jpg "The New Oxford American Dictionary") **Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy** | **Fifty Shades of Grey** is a 2011 erotic novel by British author E. L. James. Set largely in Seattle, it is the first instalment in a trilogy that traces the deepening relationship between a college graduate, Anastasia Steele, and a young business magnate, Christian Grey. It is notable for its explicitly erotic scenes featuring elements of sexual practices involving bondage/discipline, dominance/submission, sadism/masochism. Fifty Shades of Grey has attracted criticism due to its origin as a fan fiction based on the Twilight novels, with some readers predicting copyright issues due to this connection. Amanda Hayward of The Writer's Coffee Shop responded to these claims by stating that Fifty Shades of Grey "bore very little resemblance to Twilight" and that "Twilight and Fifty Shades trilogy are worlds apart". In April 2012, E. L. James was listed as one of Time magazine's "100 Most Influential People in the World", with Richard Lawson of The Atlantic Wire criticising her inclusion due to the trilogy's fan fiction beginnings.
