hello johnny  
 your epubor software is really nice but i am looking for a way to remove the limitations on how many highlighted notes i can export.  
 after one has processed the kindle book with epubor, are the restrictions on the amount of highlighted text that i can export, removed?  
 best wishes

Hi Jonny,

 Here is another option: www.notehound.com

 Note Hound creates page numbered, print edition citations from Kindle highlights that can be copied to writing/note-taking programs or downloaded as text or markdown files.

 Please feel free to try it!

 Thanks

 Any advice?
