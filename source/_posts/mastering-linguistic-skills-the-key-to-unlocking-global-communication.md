[How to Change Kindle Paperwhite Language?](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 3/9/2016 8:26:48 PM 

My first language is not English, but I bought a Kindle from American Amazon, how can I change the default language to my native language?

Can I create categories in the Epubor Reader? I notice that there are only 4 choices - Author - Language - Publisher - ISBN can I create new ones?  
 If not once you fix that I will purchase it... I have been an Ultimate user for a long time - an integrated reader where I could manage my books with a Reader and Categories would be great.

[Track numbers](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 5/13/2024 3:43:03 AM 

First of all: Great software!  
 Usually I let Epubor split my audiobooks in chapters. Unfortunately Epubor leaves the track information in the files empty. It is rather boring to enter this information in 150 files by myself. Is there a way to let Epubor enter this information when it creates the files?  
 By the way: The program window has a button in the upper right corner called "system Menu".The very first time I clicked it it contained two items, "Languages" and "About". Now there is only "About" remainig. Should that be so? Really no further adjustments?
