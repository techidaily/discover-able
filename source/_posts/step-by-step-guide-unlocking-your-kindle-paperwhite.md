With the development of Android and iOS devices, jailbreak is no longer so strange to people at present. After jailbroken we can easily modify our device and add some new and interesting features which the native system doesn't support. We've written an article of [how to jailbreak Kindle Fire](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) that has helped many Kindle Fire users. Today we'll show you how to jailbreak another popular Amazon ebook reader – the Kindle Paperwhite.

You may be confused of jailbreaking Kindle Paperwhite as it's only an e-ink eReader which runs Linux. It does not have various features like the Android-based Kindle Fire. Actually jailbreaking a Kindle Paperwhite will give you much convenience. For example, you can change the wallpaper. I bet you have been tired of the original wallpaper for a long time. Wanna change it? Just jailbreak your Kindle Paperwhite first!

### Jailbreak Kindle with Firmware Version 5.3.0/ 5.3.1/ 5.3.4/ 5.3.5

Due to the fact that Amazon has made much limitation on their devices, jailbreaking Kindle device is more difficult than others like the Android phones. In this section, the jialbreak method only applies to _**5.3.0**_, _**5.3.1**_, _**5.3.4**_ and _**5.3.5**_. Tap the setting icon at the home page to enter setting menu. Then tap the setting icon again and choose "Device Info" from the drop down menu. You'll see the Kindle Paperwhite's firmware version.

####  Step 1\. Change Kindle Paperwhite OS version

If your OS version is _**5.3.0**_, _**5.3.1**_, or _**5.3.5**_, you don't need to change the OS version. Just go to [step 2](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) directly; if your OS version is _**5.3.4**_ or _**5.3.6**_, you need to upgrade or downgrade it to _**5.3.5**_. The following is the tutorial for upgrading/downgrading Kindle Paperwhite OS version.

1\. [Click here to download _**5.3.5**_ OS .bin file](https://s3.amazonaws.com/G7G%5FFirmwareUpdates%5FWebDownloads/update%5Fkindle%5F5.3.5.bin)

2\. Turn Kindle Paperwhite into airplane mode and connect it to computer. Copy the .bin file to the root directory.

3\. Eject Kindle Paperwhite. Choose menu – setting – menu – Update Your Kindle. Then the device will reboot and you will see an upgrading progress bar. After several minutes the upgrading will finish. You can check the OS version again to see if the Kindle Paperwhite has updated to _**5.3.5**_.

#### Step 2\. Install jailbreak files

At this step, we need to put the jailbreak files into Kindle Paperwhite. [Click here to download the jailbreak zip file](https://storage.gra.cloud.ovh.net/v1/AUTH%5F2ac4bfee353948ec8ea7fd1710574097/mr-public/Touch/kindle-jailbreak-1.16.N-r18981.tar.xz). Extract the zip file and you will see these files:

![jailbreak-files](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/3-jailbreak-files.jpg)

Connect Kindle Paperwhite to your computer. Now you need to put these files into different directories of your device: Put _**MOBI8\_DEBUG**_ and _**jailbreak.sh**_ in the root directory and put _**jailbreak.mobi**_ in the "documents" folder. Just leave the _**README.txt**_ alone.

![put-files-in-documents-folder](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/5-put-files-in-documents-folder.jpg)

Eject the device and you'll find there is a new personal document at home page.

After the process has been completed, the Kindle Paperwhite will turn back to normal. You will see the new document we mentioned above has changed into another one. This means the jailbreaking is successful.

### Jailbreak Kindle with Firmware Version 5.6.5

If the firmware version is lower than 5.6.5, please [maually update it to 5.6.5](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/). If it is upper than 5.6.5, such as 5.7.2, you need to downgrade to 5.6.5\. ![jailbreak-kindle-paperwhite](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/10-jaibreak-log.jpg)

**Support Firmware version:** Only firmware version 5.6.5.

**Support Devices:** Kindle Paperwhite 2, Kindle Paperwhite 3, Kindle Touch 2, and Kindle Voyage.

Before jailbreaking, turn on Airplane Mode; Update or downgrade to the firmware version 5.6.5.

#### Step 1. **Download** the jailbreak packages. 

**Download [The Jailbreak archive (jb.zip)](http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?p=3253662#post3253662) and [the Hotfix package](http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showpost.php?p=3004892&postcount=1597).**

These two files are an essential part of successfully jailbreak. After downloading these .zip files, uncompress jb.zip and you will get a file named JB, save it and we will use it soon. Then connect Kindle to your computer with USB cable. Drag the file named JB (notice it''s not the jb.zip) to your Kindle's root directory beside the "documents" folder. Then "Safety remove" or "eject" your Kindle from computer.

#### **Step 2\. Set up jailbreak in Kindle Device.**

This step requires you to act quickly or you may failed. Open Experimental Browser on Kindle and connect to "http://45.78.56.44/jb/", If this address is failed to load, try this URL "http://kindlefere.com/jb/". You must type the full URL, include "http://", but do not contains quotation marks.

When opening it, read the notice in this page. If you fully understand the consequense of jailbreak and still want to do it, click "I Agree" button.

In the opened new page, Go to "Stage 1" first. And when it fails to load, return to the URL you entered. Go to "Stage 2" and watch the instructions on your titlebar.

After it appears "run the ;fc-cache in the search bar", click "Search bar", type “**;fc-cache**” and click enter button.

When you see a message "Jailbreak Succeeded", it means the process is finished, Turn on airplane mode quickly.

#### **Step 3\. Update your Kindle Device.**

Connect Kindle to computer again, uncompress "JailBreak-1.14.N-FW-5.x-hotfix" zip file and you will get a file named "Update\_jailbreak\_bridge\_1.14.N\_install.bin". Copy this file to your Kindle's root directory. Then eject Kindle from computer.

Open your Kindle eReader and find "Update Device" option and click it. Normally the location is Home -> Menu (Three vertical dot) ->Settings -> Menu -> Update Your Kindle. And wait for restarting.

After Kindle restarted, your kindle is fully jailbroken, and you can change the screensaver and read epub books now.

### Jailbreak Kindle Paperwhite3-4GB & Paperwhite3–32GB with Firmware 5.8.9.0.1 

The jailbreaking method provided in this section only applies to Kindle Paperwhite 3 with firmware 5.8.9.0.1 including Paperwhite 3 - 4GB and Paperwhite - manga 32GB (both devices are without special offers). Your mileage may vary if your device is with Special Offers or you have Special Offers enabled. For example, you may encounter boot loops when the factory firmware starts the first time. And if your device is passcode accessible or/and parental controls enabled, you probably will not bring your device back to normal from such boot loops. So I strongly recommend you to remove Special Offers and disable password access and parental controls before you perform the jailbreak.

#### **How to remove Special Offers from your Kindle Paperwhite 3?**

Click the menu icon from the home screen of your Kindle Paperwhite3;  
Go to “Settings”-->My Account-->Special Offers;  
Turn off “Special Offer Filtering’, “Home Screen Special Offers”, and “Screensaver Special Offers”.

Besides, please pay attention to your Kindle’s registration. Any change to the registration status (such as switching account, deregistration) will make you face the risk of losing the application keys install by the hotfix package. You may have to re-install the hotfix if you change registration status.

To ensure the jailbreak runs smoothly, you also need to block OTA updates before connecting your Kindle device to internet, so as to prevent firmware from updating automatically. Please create an OTA blocker directory folder under your Kindle root directory, and rename the folder to **update.bin.tmp.partial**. Use the exact folder name, don’t add file extension or put any contents into the folder.

Then please perform the steps written in the previous section in this article [“Jailbreak Kindle with Firmware Version 5.8.x”](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) as it share the same jailbreak procedure. Only the specific firmware for Paperwhite 3 and hotfix package need to be updated. Please set your Kindle Paperwhite to airplane mode and make sure it is fully charged during the procedure.

Download the specific firmware for Kindle Paperwhite 3:   
[firmware for PW3 factory 5.8.9.0.1](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=291336)

Download the current hotfix package:  
[current hotfix package](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=158236&d=1501804569)

For the last updating your Kindle Paperwhite firmware version part in the previous section of the article, please refer to [how-to-downgrade-kindle-firmware-2017](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/), but take notice of the following modification:  
For Paperwhite3 – 32GB, please don’t use the firmware link in that article, but use [this file](https://s3.amazonaws.com/firmwaredownloads/update%5Fkindle%5Fall%5Fnew%5Fpaperwhite%5F5.8.9.bin) or get a 5.8.9.2 or newer firmware from Amazon. (5.8.10 or 5.8.11 are also ok).

Finally, today I didn't unplug the Kindle at all, I just kept the power button pressed for something like 30 seconds and it started the "update" procedure which successfully completed. Now I will just do what I had to do from the beginning, jailbreak it.  
 So, if you have the latest firmware, just copy it in the root and press the power button of the Kindle long enough. Don't bother to close the Kindle directory on the computer - it will close by itself.  
 Good luck and thanks to the people who came with the idea!

 The OS is now back down to 5.3.5

1\. Disable wifi on your Paperwhite 1 (airplane mode).  
 2\. Connect your Kindle Paperwhite 1 to your computer (DO NOT DISCONNECT UNTIL LAST  
 STEP!).  
 3\. Copy the .bin file you downloaded to root folder of Kindle.  
 4\. Wait at least 2 minutes after copy has completed. (it required to make sure the file is copied).  
 5\. Push and hold power button until your Kindle restarts (the led blinks orange and  
 light turns on at the screen).  
 6\. Wait until the Kindle has installed the upgrade (really a downgrade).  
 7\. Now you can DISCONNECT from your computer.

 \-Plug in Kindle to desktop via USB  
 \-Move the update\_kindle\_5.3.5.bin file to the Kindle root directory  
 \-Do not unplug Kindle from Computer  
 \-Hold the Kindle's power button for about 30 seconds  
 \-I got a message that I didn't eject the device properly, but then my Kindle automatically started updating to 5.3.5

 Can I now update to the latest available version (5.8.10) without loosing the jailbreak? I don't understand from your tutorial if I can update to the latest available version or the latest jailbreak-compatible version.

Does this work with Kindle Paperwhite 1? I have firmware 5.6.1.1, but I know how to downgrade it. Just want to be sure that at least part of this article is applicable to my Kindle so I don't brick it.

Can you upload firmware version 5.13.4 for paperwhite 10th gen? I can't find it anywhere, and I believe by copying and keeping the power button pressed 30 secs it will force the update.

worked well, successfully downgraded firmware on a Paper\*\* 3\. everything worked up until step 5..... jailbreak files missing

 Suitable for Kindle Oasis, Kindle Voyage, Kindle Paper\*\*\*te 2/3, Kindle Touch 2/3

 1\. Download main-html\*viewer\*tar\* (WORKS)

 2\. Plug your Kindle device in a computer. When the Kindle disk displays, you can copy "main\*html\*\* file to the Kindle root directory (at the same level with the documents folder). (WORKS)

 3\. Eject your Kindle device. At the home page of your Kindle device, you can see the search bar. Enter ;installHtml and confirm. The semicolon is a part of the contents you must input. (WORKS)

 4\. After the above steps, if the Kindle screen flashes and Kindle begin to reboot, it means you keep the right pace and you can continue the rest of the procession. (WORKS)

 5\. Download Jail\*\*\*\*\*hot\*fix\*zip (THIS STEP DOESN"T WORK, asterisks added so the bots would let me post this question)

  
 When clicking the link on step 5...... takes to the mobil\*read page, but the "Kindle PaperWhite 3 (2015)" option is grayed out with no link. All the instructions on the mobil\*read page and the other links lead to other firmware versions... not 5.7.4 that was just installed. I'm afraid to try installing a wrong jailbreak firmware file. Help?

Since you can't downgrade the kindle firmware 5.12.1 to older version, so you cannot jailbreak it any more.

"Part 5\. Jailbreak Kindle PaperWhite 4 with Firmware Version 5.10.2-5.13.3"  
 Part 5 has a broken link:  
 FW 5.10.1.3 Diags which directs to https://mega.nz/file/fjYCAbxC#qGYDDn...lppriic\_CB6oio  
 Mega.nz says the decryption key is invalid. Maybe this is because the key #qGYDDn...lppriic\_CB6oio has three dots because something shrunk it and deleted characters? For example the file "FW 5.10.1.3 Factory"'s key is a lot longer: #qrjmx6KI156yAUcHF4\_1s-gYl4Vp9N3JHaaw-da0VXQ and directs to valid file. Thank you in forward :)

Same question as OilyBlob from 10/4\. Can someone please tell us? I'd like to buy a new Paperwhite during Black Friday sales but even the previous generation model apparently comes with 5.13.6 and I have many ePubs I don't want to convert. It's a PITA plus some don't convert correctly. So if I can't put a native ePub reader on it, I won't buy.
