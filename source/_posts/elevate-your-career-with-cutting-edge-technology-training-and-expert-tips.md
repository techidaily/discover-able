Long time user of Epubor ultimate. Since Kindle 1.24 stopped working after upgrade to Catalina, moved to KCR converter. But have noticed that Kindle books converted to epub using KCR are slow. And also have low quality covers. Is there any way to just de-drm using KCR and then convert them to epub using ultimate?

Hello, I have the Epubor Ultimate v3.0.12.412 and I am getting the warning message for the Kindle version is 1.28.0.57030 and it says to downgrade. I followed instructions to de-register, and then download the required file, install, register, turn off automatic update in Kindle before closing. Now, when I close Kindle, and open it, Kindle upgrades itself, even with the "automatic" upgrade is turned off. What's going on? Thanks

Hello,  
 I use and love Epubor Ultimate. I use it to convert purchased ebooks from Amazon to epub to use in a text to speech app as I don't see so good anymore.

 I have kindle on my pc to not aromatically upgrade, but is does so anyhow. I use the downgrade feature from within epubor and it takes only a minute or so. Is there a way to stop kindle from automatically upgrading?

 Great program.
