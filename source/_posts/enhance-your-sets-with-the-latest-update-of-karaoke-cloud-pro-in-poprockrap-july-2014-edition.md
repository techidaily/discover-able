## **JULY 2014 Karaoke Cloud Pro Update: POP/ROCK/RAP Pack**

[Karaoke Cloud Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) is a professional karaoke subscription offered by Digitrax Entertainment (formally Chartbuster Karaoke). The subscription service is the only one of it’s kind for pro KJs and venues, and subscribers can use the in-app subscription for public performance — _it’s 100% legal for commercial use._

PCDJ Karaoki, our [best karaoke software](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) designed for KJs that demand the best singer rotation management, has Karaoke Cloud Pro directly integrated. Just sign in through PCDJ Karaoki and you’ll have immediate access to around 10,000 high-quality karaoke songs from some of the best brands in the business. The manufacturers include: **Digitrax** (Formally Chartbuster), **DK**, **Sunfly**, **SBI** and **Stage Stars**. New tunes are added all the time at no additional charge for subscribers, and since you download the files to your local hard drive you only have to sync with the online server once a month to verify you’re still paying. This means you can use [PCDJ Karaoki](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) with the [Karaoke Cloud Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) service offline, _without an internet connection_. Recently, the terms of service have been updated so that users can start or stop the service as they deem necessary, so there is no longer a 12 month contract!
